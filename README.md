# 👋 Hi, I’m Mehmet

I am a Computer Science Foundation student at Solent University, focused on clarity, problem‑solving, and building a strong technical foundation.  
My learning approach is inspired by Harvard’s CS50 — prioritizing deep understanding over shortcuts.

Rather than rushing through topics or collecting certificates, I prefer to build a solid base, explore concepts deeply, and reinforce everything through hands‑on projects and structured documentation.

---

## 🎯 My Learning Philosophy

I approach learning with intention and discipline.  
I strongly believe that **real mastery comes from understanding, not speed**.

- I don’t follow rigid timelines like “finish HTML in 2 weeks”
- I only move forward once I fully understand a topic
- Every concept is reinforced through **hands‑on mini projects**
- Each project includes a **professional README**
- Every project is deployed live to show real‑world usage

I see my learning journey as a **long‑term investment**, where each small project becomes a piece of a future professional portfolio.

## 🧠 Learning & Note‑Taking Workflow

- **Notion** → High‑level notes, summaries, concepts  
- **Obsidian** → Deep technical knowledge (especially JavaScript)  
- **GitHub** → Version control + portfolio  
- **Netlify** → Live deployment for early‑stage projects  
- **Vercel** → Advanced deployments later on

## 📁 Project Strategy

Each repository includes:

- Clean and readable code  
- A **professional README**  
- Clear project purpose  
- Live demo link  
- Progressive improvement mindset  

Each project is treated as a **real deliverable**, not a tutorial exercise.

## 🚀 First Project

**About Me Page**  
A simple but well‑structured HTML project created on day one, serving as the foundation for future improvements and refactoring as new skills are acquired.

---

## 🌱 Long‑Term Goal

To build a **strong academic and professional portfolio** that:

- Demonstrates consistency and discipline  
- Shows deep understanding of core concepts  
- Stands out in job applications  
- Reflects real‑world development practices
