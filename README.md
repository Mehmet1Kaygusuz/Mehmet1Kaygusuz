# 👋 Hi, I’m Mehmet

I am a **Computer Science Foundation student at Solent University** and an aspiring **Full Stack Web Developer** with a strong focus on building solid fundamentals and learning deeply rather than rushing through topics.

Alongside my academic studies, I am currently enrolled in **Colt Steele’s 2026 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy**, where I am systematically progressing through modern web technologies.

## 🎯 My Learning Philosophy

I strongly believe that **real mastery comes from understanding, not speed**.

* I do not follow rigid timelines like “finish HTML in 2 weeks”
* I only move forward once I fully understand a topic
* Every concept is reinforced through **hands-on mini projects**
* Each project is documented with a **professional README**
* Every project is deployed live to showcase real-world usage

I see my learning journey as a **long-term investment**, where each small project is a puzzle piece that eventually forms a powerful and professional portfolio.

## 🧠 Learning & Note-Taking Workflow

* **Notion** → High-level notes, summaries, concepts
* **Obsidian** → Deeper technical knowledge (especially JavaScript and beyond)
* **GitHub** → Version control + portfolio
* **Netlify** → Live deployment for early-stage projects
* **Vercel** → Advanced deployments in later stages

## 🛠️ Technologies & Progress

### ✅ Completed

* HTML (Fundamentals & Semantic Structure)

### 🔄 In Progress

* CSS (Layouts, Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design)

### 🔜 Upcoming

* JavaScript (8–12 weeks, deep focus)
* Backend Development
* Databases
* Full Stack Projects

---

## 📁 Project Strategy

Each repository includes:

* Clean and readable code
* A **professional README**
* Clear project purpose
* Live demo link
* Progressive improvement mindset

Think of these projects as **weekly episodes of a high-quality series** — by the end of the season, the result should feel cohesive, impressive, and professional.
